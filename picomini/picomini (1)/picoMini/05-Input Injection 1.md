## Solution
1. Looking at the source code we can see that this is a stack buffer overflow.
	![](Pasted%20image%2020251005143513.png)
	We need to craft a payload that overflows the variable "buffer" to be able to write in the "c" that is used in system(), the function that executes commands.
2. We use this payload:
	```pwnedbyfercat *```
		name will cointain 10 bytes \[pwnedbyfer\] and c will contail \[cat \*\] :
